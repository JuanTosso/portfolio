        <p>I am a person who seeks professional and personal growth, focused on teamwork, last year I made the decision to reinvent myself professionally so I started training in an area that I have always been passionate about; programming.</p>
        <p>Being a creative person I have focused on the frontend and UX/UI area, because I firmly believe that solutions can be solved efficiently where design, user experience and functionality are important parts in the development of any web application.</p>
