          Hello! üëãüèª I'm Juan. My background includes accounting and economics,

        <p>
          Starting in late 2022, I committed to transitioning my career into
          technology. I enrolled in the Full Stack Development program at Henry,
          which became a transformative journey. Now, after completing my
          program, I am now entering the world of the technology workforce,
          having already had my first experience as a Full Stack Developer. My
          key strengths include problem-solving, studying new technologies, and
          pragmatism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond seeking a job, I'm dedicated to self-education, tech immersion,
          and networking with professionals to collectively thrive. If you're in
          search of a motivated, results-driven learner, I'd love to connect.
